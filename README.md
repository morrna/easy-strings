## Easy Strings

I made this script because I like using random passwords,
but I kept being slowed down by how difficult they can be to type in.
This is an attempt to make strings with some randomness
that flow more easily from the fingers.

The entropy in these strings will be definitely be less than that of fully random strings.
I would be interested in knowing what their entropy is from anyone who knows information theory.
Also, I have not included any way of requiring or excluding numbers, cases, or special characters.
If you want a string that meets specific criteria, you may just want to generate a bunch
and pick one that works.
